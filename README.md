# â˜† Twit.py

Built with Tweepy to automate Twitter tasks for multiple accounts

Requirements are:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* My fork of Tweepy (https://github.com/mycxle/tweepy) - adds video uploads
* Mega-Util (https://github.com/mycxle/Mega-Util) - for posting media stored on Mega.nz
* feedparser (https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) - for web scraping content
* Twitter account + Twitter Application credentials

Setup a data folder with: `accounts.xml, config.xml, and tasks.xml` 
<br>
Then schedule the script to run once every hour. That's it.
